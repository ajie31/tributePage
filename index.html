                                was an Argentine professional football player and manager.
                                Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time,
                                he was one of the two joint winners of the FIFA Player of the 20th Century award.
                                Maradona's vision, passing, ball control, and dribbling skills were combined with his small stature,
                                which gave him a low centre of gravity allowing him to manoeuvre better than most other players.

                        <p class="typeContent">After the 1982 World Cup, in June,
                            Maradona was transferred to Barcelona in Spain for a
                            then world record fee of £5 million ($7.6 million).
                            In 1983, under coach César Luis Menotti,
                            Barcelona and Maradona won the Copa del Rey
                            (Spain's annual national cup competition),
                            beating Real Madrid, and the Spanish Super Cup,
                            beating Athletic Bilbao. On 26 June 1983,
                            Barcelona won away to Real Madrid in one of the
                            world's biggest club games, El Clásico, a match where
                            Maradona scored and became the first Barcelona player
                            to be applauded by arch-rival Real Madrid fans.

                        <p class="typeContent">At Napoli, Maradona reached the peak of his professional
                             career: he soon inherited the captain's armband from
                             Napoli veteran defender Giuseppe Bruscolotti and quickly
                             became an adored star among the club's fans;
                             in his time there he elevated the team to the most
                             successful era in its history.[45] Maradona played
                             for Napoli at a period when north–south tensions in
                             Italy were at a peak due to a variety of issues,
                             notably the economic differences between the two.
                             Led by Maradona, Napoli won their first ever Serie A
                             Italian Championship in 1986–87.
